		<h2>Spread Constraint</h2>
		<h3>Purpose</h3> 
		<p> 
		The purpose of this research is to implement the Spread Constraint propagation algorithm described by Pierre Schaus
		on his <a href="pdf/SpreadConstraintPaperByPierre.pdf"> <span> paper</span></a>. 
		</p> 
		<h3>Goal</h3> 
		<p>
		To implement the Spread Constraint successfully onto the open source SCIP library. 
		</p> 
		<h3>Theoretical Challenges</h3>		
		<h4>Claims Without Proofs</h4> 
		<p>
			To be able to implement algorithms from a research paper, I need to be able to understand everything on the paper in great detail. 
			As proofs are often omitted from research papers, I needed to proof all the claims that were given. In fact, I was able to prove
			that a claim given by the <a href="pdf/SpreadConstraintPaperByPierre.pdf"> <span> paper</span></a> was only correct for special cases.
			After doing so, I fully understood the paper and was able to implement the algorithms described successfully.
		</p> 
		<h4>Lack of Implementation Details</h4> 
		<p>
			Although the paper describes in detail the high level theory to solve the problem, the actual implementation is rather complicated 
			and has a lot of corner cases that needs to be handled. I had to account for all corner cases in code. 
		</p> 		
		<h4>Piecewise Functions</h4> 
		<p>
			The functions that are involved in solving the problem are piecewise defined functions. Therefore, I needed to solve each piece of the function
			individually in code in order for the algorithm to work. This also complicates the algorithm as the code needs to loop through each piece
			to both identify which piece of the function it is currently in, as well as work differently depending on which piece of the function it is.
			To illustrate, the piece may currently contain a global minimum, contain the end points, or none. 
			Also, the algorithms for calculating the maximum shift needed to be recursive in order to recursively set up the variables
			whenever it changes to a different piece of the function. 
		</p> 		
		<h4>Tedious Math</h4> 
		<p>
			Calculation of the second derivative to find the global maximum of a function may sound pretty trivial. However, the function 
			that was involved in this problem was fairly complicated as it involves a lot of different variables that carry different values 
			at each piece of the piecewise continuous functions. In fact, a piece from the piecewise function may not contain the global maximum. Next, 
			it is difficult to verify if my calculations were correct. In order to overcome this issue, 
			I used both Wolfram Alpha and MatLab to solve the functions. As a result, I was able to skip solving tedious 
			mathematical calculation and check my work. MatLab is able to solve derivatives and equations using its symbolic variables. 
		</p> 		'
		<h4> General Mean Values </h4>
		<p>
			As a claim given for the general mean values in the paper was only correct for special cases, this means that I needed to design my own 
			algorithm in order to work with the correction that works with the general case. I did so and it works. More details on the algorithm I designed and its implementation 
			is available on the report. 
		</p>
		
		<h3>Result</h3> 
		<p>
			I was able to successfully implement the Spread Constraint and its propagation algorithm for both given and general mean values on SCIP. 
			I have tested its correctness by ensuring that it doesn't prune out the optimal value. Also, I have compared it with the commercial solver, 
			CP Optimizer (claimed by Prof. Christopher Beck to be the best solver at the time of writing), and it appears that 
			the algorithms that I implemented and designed prunes more tightly compared to CP Optimizer's Spread Constraint. 
			
			Also, I was able to find an incomplete statement in one of the claims given by the paper. I have clarified this with the author, Pierre Schaus himself
			via email and he agrees that I was able to find and incomplete statement on his paper and that algorithm that I designed should work with the correction.
			For more details regarding this, refer to the report that I have written. 
			
			As the <a href="pdf/SpreadConstraintPaperByPierre.pdf"> <span> paper</span></a> does not cover the mathematical details and programming implementation details, 
			I have wrote a report on my expertise for the Spread Constraint using LaTeX below. 
			I have also included the <a href="pdf/SpreadConstraintPaper.pdf"> <span>paper</span></a> I submitted that is currently pending review for acceptance.

		<h3>Reflection</h3> 
		<h4>Prove Everything</h4> 
		<p>
		I decided to prove everything except one claim, as I felt I spent too much time proving the other claims that were given. 
		As a result, I had to design an algorithm assuming that the one claim that I didn't prove was correct. As the output of the code looks incorrect, 
		I decided to prove that final claim. It turns out that the final claim was incomplete. This means that all my hard work in 
		designing and implementing an algorithm that works assuming the claim was correct is now only partially correct. Therefore, I needed to redesign 
		an algorithm in order to work with the correction. I would have saved a lot of time if I prove that one claim was incorrect first, as
		I would not have designed and implemented an algorithm, which was based on a false claim, making the algorithm itself wrong.
