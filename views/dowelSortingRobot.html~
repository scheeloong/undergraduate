		<h3>Purpose</h3> 
		<p> 
		The purpose of this robot is to sort twelve white or brown dowels out of a maximum total of twenty-four dowels
		into two different boxes autonomously. <br>
		First, the user loads as many brown dowels into a loading compartment for brown dowels in any matter.
		Similarly, the user repeats this step for the white dowels into a different compartment.
		Upon loading, the user enters two of the six available patterns onto the Keypad. 
		After selecting both patterns, the robot must then sort white and brown dowels according to the first selected pattern to the first box.
		Then, the robot must sort another six dowels to the second box. Both boxes must be closed and delivered back to the user autonomously.				
		</p> 
		<h3>Goal</h3> 
		Our team goal was to fully design and implement a functional autonomous robot that does functions as specified in its purpose above. 
		</p> 
		<h3>Design Challenges</h3>
		<h4>Aligning the dowels</h4> 
		<p>
		As the user is allowed to load dowels into the compartments in any matter,
		the robot has to be able to orient the dowels properly such that it is functional for packaging.
		Our team decided to solve this problem with the use of a Reservoir and angular momentum as shown in <em>Video 1</em>.
		</p> 
		
		<h4>Transporting the dowels to two different boxes</h4> 
		<p>
The robot has to be completely autonomous.
Therefore, there has to be some way for the robot to package the dowels into the first box, and then into the second box.
A simple design would be to use a conveyor belt. 
Our team decided to solve this problem with our unique design of the Carousel that rotates both boxes to
different stations of the robot to execute different tasks.		
		</p> 
		
		<h3>Result</h3> 
		<p>
		The project works as intended but only with white dowels only. 
		The final results are shown in <em>Video 1</em>.

		<h3>Reflection</h3> 
		<h4>Account for all requirements into the design</h4> 
		<p>
		Our team spent a lot of time downsizing the robot due to its heavy weight 
		as we overlooked a requirement to maintain a maximum weight of 6kg for the robot. 
		After designing the robot, we figured it would be best to build the entire robot with wood as that was Tommy’s expertise.
		We later regretted our decision when we found out that the robot’s weight was more than 6kg. 
		We spent 20 hours reducing the robot’s weight to 6kg.
